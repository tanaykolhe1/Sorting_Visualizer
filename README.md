# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer


## Project Context:
There are multiple sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, etc. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization. This project is made to let everyone understand how these algorithms work.


This project visualizes four most commonly used sorting algorithms: *bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort*. User can run the program on a local machine and see how each algorithm works in action, and how elements are swapped in the array to get to the sorted array in the end.


## Tech-stack used:
1) ***HTML*** - to build a basic layout of the webpage
2) ***CSS & Bootstrap*** - designing of the webpage
3) ***JavaScript*** - to execute the working process of sorting algorithms
